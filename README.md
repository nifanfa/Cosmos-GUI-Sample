# Importance Note
# Note: Cosmos has serious memory problem. Such a GUI will crash in a few minute even worse. Second. Cosmos's filesystem is buggy. i'm sure the file won't be loaded correctly.
Add those files which is tagged by "Add To Filesystem.vmdk" to C:\Users\Your User Name\AppData\Roaming\Cosmos User Kit\Build\VMware\Workstation\filesystem.vmdk
